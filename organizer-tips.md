The OpenStack User Group HOWTO is intended to serve as a guide to founding,
maintaining, and growing an OpenStack user group.

Starting a new OpenStack User Group
-----------------------------------

Based on the experiences gathered by other OpenStack user groups, like the
San Francisco User Group, the questions and answers below will help guide
you to creating a sustainable user group. We have an
[Ambassador Program](https://groups.openstack.org/ambassador-program),
which you can ask for help for mentoring through the process.

Here are the steps to create a new OpenStack User Group:

1. Contact your local [Ambassador](https://groups.openstack.org/ambassador-program),
   they're here to help you through the process!
2. Add yourself to the mailing list for
   [community organisers](http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/community).
3. Check the [User Group List](https://groups.openstack.org/) to double-check
   there is no existing group nearby. If there is a group in your city,
   contact their organisers and offer to help. Note that some countries have
   an umbrella group that covers the entire country.
4. It takes a lot of work to start and operate a user group, so make sure that
   you get at least one additional person to help you and act as a backup.
5. Find your audience. Who do you want to attract to your user group meetings?
   Where do they live and work? What will their skill level be? What content
   do they want?
6. Ask for more volunteers - many people are willing to assist with tasks like
   registration, contacting lecturers, hosting meetings, sending reminders,
   taking photos.
7. [Register a new group](https://groups.openstack.org/node/add/group) in the
   Groups Portal. Ensure you fill in the description and add all the details
   to allow your audience to find you. Once your Ambassador approves the
   request, add your co-organisers as administrators.
8. Announce the new group on the openstack mailing lists and any social media
   that is popular in your location.

Working with different skill levels
-----------------------------------
Even though you may be an OpenStack expert, not everyone who comes to your
group will be. Here are some tips for the various skill levels we've observed:

- Beginner: If you want to attract new users to OpenStack then you will want
  to discuss the architecture and the basics of how to use OpenStack.
  There are many suitable presentations available online.
- Intermediate:  Developers and operators that want to understand how to make
  OpenStack production ready for their organization need a place to discuss
  setups, review and share topics like details on APIs, package installation,
  and configuration. You might teach new attendees how to use devstack, or
  hold bug squash hackathons for developers.
- Advanced: Some groups tend to call this a ''devOps meeting''. The topics
  are generally about blueprints, advanced operations, or specific deep dive
  into part of OpenStack like Neutron. You may ask OpenStack developers for
  assistance with the advanced meetings, even if they can only present
  remotely.

Planning your meetings
----------------------
A surprising amount of effort goes into making an informal gathering
successful. Here are some quick tips.

- Attendance: For free events, it's not uncommon that 30% of people who
  register don't show up, so plan accordingly. Track the no-show rate for
  improved planning.
- Sponsorship: There are many vendors in the OpenStack community who are
  happy to provide space, food and drink, or money in exchange for placing
  their logo on your group page, putting up banners or giving a 5-minute pitch.
  Go through the [list of companies](http://openstack.org/community/companies/)
  and contact who you can in your area. If the company is serious about being
  involved they will help you out! Ask them if they can do a short talk on
  their company's involvement with OpenStack.
- Food and drink: If you can afford it or have a sponsor, it makes the
  meetings much more sociable.
- Promotion: Look for local sysops/sysadmin/network ops email lists or online
  forums and promote your events there to get folks along. Also write to the
  Heads of Schools of the University IT faculties in the area and
  invite them and their school along.
- Content: Your topics will your different types of users who attend. Have a
  look at other user groups on the groups portal to see what they have done
  recently, or ask your ambassador for help. An interesting user story is
  always a good  bet. Once you have an idea of content, you can contact
  potential speakers.
- Location: This is critical part of your user group. It makes your life much
  easier if you can find a location that will be there long term. There may
  be a local function room that is under-utilized early in the week, or
  cloud computing companies in your area may have a conference room. Local
  universities, technical colleges or co-working spaces may also be interested.
  Check other non-OpenStack user groups in your city. And ask your friends,
  relatives and colleagues about other meetings they have gone to. Free spaces
  can be found basically everywhere in the world.
- Materials: there are some basic meeting materials you will want to go ensure
  are present. White boards, projectors, tables and chairs are the basics.
  The location you secured may have a few of these things, but don't assume
  they do.
- Other Venue Preparation: Consider after-hours heating or cooling, lighting,
  and security. A small room can get hot or cold, very quickly with the air
  conditioning turned off. Sometimes our security forgets the event and locks
  our doors.
- Reminder Announcements: A lot of OpenStack User Group use [Meetup](http://meetup.com)
  to announce their meeting, since it automatically sends reminders. You can
  pick the tool you prefer to organize your events.
- Afterward: keep the conversations going online after a meeting. In order to
  support those who couldn't make it this time, collect materials such as
  speech scripts, photos, video, and reports and  make them accessible online
  as much as possible, Collecting the material immediately at the event works
  better than chasing speakers afterward. Write a blog post and share the
  materials.

Example Planning Schedule
-------------------------
This is an example planning schedule from the SFBay OpenStack User Group.

    1. Establish dates and times at least 6 months in advance
    2. Schedule speakers, assistants at least a month in advance
    3. Schedule tweets and emails to go out 7, 2, 1, and 0 days before the meetup reminding possible attendees of the meetup.  Examples below
      * T-7 day 11:30: @[[OpenStack]] #OSSFO hackathon meetup happening next Thursday at #Yahoo Sunnyvale, RSVP via ow.ly/g2V3u, webex avail
      * T-2 day 11:30: @[[OpenStack]] #OSSFO hackathon meetup happening next Thursday at #Yahoo Sunnyvale, RSVP via ow.ly/g2V3u, webex avail
      * T-1 day 11:30: @[[OpenStack]] #OSSFO hackathon meetup happening tomorrow at #Yahoo Sunnyvale, RSVP via ow.ly/g2V3u, webex avail
      * T-0 day 11:30: @[[OpenStack]] #OSSFO hackathon meetup happening today at #Yahoo Sunnyvale, RSVP via ow.ly/g2V3u, webex avail
    - Schedule an email to go out to the community mailing list with the same content
      * To: community@lists.openstack.org
      * Subject: [[OpenStack]] SFBay hackathon next Thursday
      * Body: @[[OpenStack]] #OSSFO hackathon meetup happening next Thursday at
      * #Yahoo Sunnyvale, RSVP via http://meetup.com/openstack, webex avail. More updates via @sarob
    4. Book your meeting space at least 1 month in advance
    5. Notify security about the meetup and so they can provide directions so
       visitors do not get lost
    6. Order the food at least 3 days in advance. A good gauge is about 70% of the
       RSVPs actually show up. Better topics get a higher percentage turnout.
    7. Prep the room about an hour before the meetup. Check the AV equipment,
      power strips, seats, food, drink, and white boards are ready to go. Setup
      the video camera, so you know where the static viewing area is. Line up
      the projector screen to be in the picture. Lay down a tape box where the
      speaker should stand. Dial into the audio conference line. If you are using
      webex or youtube, check for connection to the remote server.
    8. Post Meetup: After the meeting, you can prepare a summary blog post with
       images, links to video, marketing updates for the OpenStack blog.


User Groups covering larger geographical areas
----------------------------------------------
The exact spread of a user group, in terms of the area it covers and how it is
managed, depends on the needs of the area and its cultural norms. Some regions
value independence and autonomy (eg a city taking care of its own needs),
whereas others prefer more coordination and sharing (a nationally coordinated
group with meetings in multiple cities). This section aims to provide some
examples of the latter:

- Australia - Due to the sparse population, the group is centrally coordinated
  at a national level, with one group entry and meetup.com page. Local
  organisers in each city arrange events to post on the central page, and
  national coordinators help share speakers and organisational practices
  between cities.
- China - There are leaders in several cities who organise the local meetup
  group there, and each city has their own group entry/meetup.com page.
  However, for national events such as China Day, and to help start and mentor
  new groups, leaders based in various locations come together to collaborate
  nation-wide. Some highly respected leaders are granted administrative rights
  over the meetup.com pages of the local city groups, in addition to the local
  organisers.
- India - A strong national-level group helps mentor leaders in many cities,
  and organises nation-wide events like India Day. Local groups organise
  events and post them on single group entry/meetup.com page.
- USA - no national coordination, each city has a completely separate
  meetup.com group and organising team. Coordinated loosely by ambassadors,
  using the Official User Group Process to avoid overlapping claims.
